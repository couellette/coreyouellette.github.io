There was some criticism for this but it is hard to blame Tony Khan for wanting to bring in the best possible free agents, and many of those arrived on the back of WWE releases.\n\nNot all of these signings have been a success unfortunately, and have ultimately been failures for AEW. The level of 'failure' for each of these wrestlers is different based on their standings in the company, and the reason for a lack of success can come down to various factors.",

The event is AEW: All In London, and with a capacity of 90,000, will be the largest event AEW has ever run. AEW's attendance record is currently at 20,177, which was Dynamite Grand Slam at Arthur Ashe Stadium, so even if the stadium is half full, it will soar past that total. There have been some detractors since the announcement, and Chris Jericho had a message for all those who are being critical of the move and proclaimed the event a failure before it has even happened.",
